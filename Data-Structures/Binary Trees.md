## Binary Tree Data Structure?
- root node + subtree(s)

- some terms

  > B, C are children of A = A is a parent of B and C

  > Descendent of C are E, F, G, H, I

  > root node is at depth 0(=level 0), below, there are depth 1,2,3(=level 1,2,3)

  > height of the tree = Maximal level + 1
  
  > leaf node := A node without any child <-> internal node
    - internal node + leaf node = all node
  
  > B is an internal node because it has a child.
  
  > root node can be internal node or leaf node


- path : sequence of nodes

  > Path from A to G is : A C E G


- Full Binary Tree vs. Complete Binary Tree

  > Full Binary Tree : all internal nodes have 2 children.(애가 있으려면 2명이 있어야)
  
  > Complete Binary Tree : Last Level 말고는 모두 Completely Full, Bottom Level에는 왼쪽으로 차곡차곡
  
  > single node도 full binary / complete binary 일 수 있음.


- Full Binary Tree Theorem

  > Leaves = Internal node + 1
